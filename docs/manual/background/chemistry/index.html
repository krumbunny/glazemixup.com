    <h2>A Quick Potter's Tour of Glaze Chemistry</h2>
<p>Pottery involves a lot of process and transformation,
with lots of opportunity for magic to happen or things to go wrong.
The biggest changes to a pot happen during firing, where high heat changes
dry clay covered with powdered rock to ceramic encased in a thin layer of glass.
The change from unfired to fired is dramatic and often unpredictable.</p>
<p>A lot of the changes to a pot while it's in the kiln are chemical.
In particular what happens when the raw glaze melts is largely driven by
what kinds of atoms are part of the glaze.
A basic chemical understanding goes
a long ways towards fixing common glaze problems like under firing, crazing,
substituting a material or fixing the fit.</p>
<p>Fortunately complicated chemistry isn't needed.
For example there aren't any chemical reactions to worry about.
The kind of chemistry analysis that Mixup provides is fairly simple but is
nevertheless useful for getting a basic handle on what's going on.
In a nutshell, for a given glaze, Mixup goes through the ingredients, tallies up
what kind oxides are present, and gives you the summary analysis.</p>
<p>The main thing is to learn what role each oxide plays.
You could even give them personalities, as in
Boring Silica, Stodgy Alumina, Exuberant Soda, Dependable Calcia and so forth.</p>
<p>Glaze chemistry is an established field,
with books written and college courses developed.
Some online resources include:</p>

</ul>
<p>where you will find more complete explanations.</p>
<h3>The Really Brief Version</h3>
<p>Most glazes are slurries of crushed rocks and water. You dip your pot in,
it soaks up some slurry, the water dries and
you are left with powder on the outside of the pot.</p>
<p>When you fire your pot and the kiln is at temperature the powdered glaze
on the outside melts and becomes a thick liquid.
In that hot liquid the molecules that were bound up in various rocky crystals
and other materials are
freed to roam around and interact with other molecules. It's molecule soup.</p>
<p>When the kiln is turned off and the pot cools the soup freezes - that's the glaze.
Sometimes the soup freezes relatively quickly and the molecules are caught off guard,
as if they were still in that liquid melt, creating a clear glaze.
Other times the molecules have time to
find a friend and create a small crystal or an optical blip, leading to matte glazes
and other effects.</p>
<h3>Oxides</h3>
<p>You <em>could</em> think about the molecules in that glaze soup in terms of elements,
like silicon or iron or aluminum, but there's one element
that is almost always attached - oxygen.
We live in a world bathed in oxygen and it's very reactive.
Oxygen glues itself to other elements and doesn't let go, even at kiln temperatures.
So when it comes to glazes it's best to think not about elements but oxides -
the element plus it's tag along oxygen.</p>
<p>So in glaze parlance you would talk about Sodium (Na) as Soda (Na2O).
Silicon (Si) as Silica (SiO2), Potassium (K) as Potash (K2O),
Aluminum (Al) as Alumina (Al2O3), Magnesium (Mg) as Magnesia (MgO) and so on.
An element is usually attached to oxygen, and together they are an oxide.
These oxides are the main characters in glaze chemistry.
They are the building blocks of glazes.</p>
<p>Elements like to pair up with oxygen in different ratios.
Some prefer two atoms to one oxygen, like Soda (Na2O) and Potash (K2O).
Others pair one to one, like Calcia (CaO) and Magnesia (MgO).
A ratio of two to three is how Alumina (Al2O3), Boron (B2O3)
and Iron (Fe2O3) like to pair.
Silica and Titania pair up at one to two (SiO2 and TiO2).</p>
<p>Glazes are mostly composed of silica and alumina,
but by themselves they're pretty inert.
To get those oxides to melt at kiln temperatures we introduce fluxes,
like soda, potash and calcia.
These fluxes make the alumina and silica melt at lower temperatures.
There is also a whole herd of additive oxides,
like iron oxide (<em>aka</em> rust), boron oxide, and titania,
that add color and texture.</p>
<p>The common oxides we see in glazes are also incidentally what the
<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/0127/report.pdf">world is made out of</a>.
Your average mountain is mostly silica and alumina,
usually bound up with some other oxides in various rocky minerals.
A very common type of mineral is <em>feldspar</em>,
where one of those flux oxides is bound up in a package with alumina and silica.
If you wash away that flux over the eons you might wind up with just some alumina,
silica and chemical water bound together in tiny platelets.
That's <em>clay</em>.</p>
<p>So you can see why a feldspar is a good starting point for getting the
basic oxide ingredients you need for a glaze.
Add some more silica and clay (for alumina) as needed,
some flux material to get it all to melt,
maybe an additive for color, and voila, you have a glaze!</p>
