title: About Mixup
---
*Mixup* is written by Ken Chin-Purcell. I'm a potter and a programmer. 

There a many programs for managing glazes, and I encourage you to check them out and pick 
the best one for your needs. They include:
- [Glazy](https://glazy.org)
- [HyperGlaze](http://hyperglaze.com)
- [Matrix](http://www.matrix2000.co.nz)
- [Insight](https://www.digitalfire.com)

I point these out because *Mixup* takes a simplified and fairly opinionated approach, 
so it may not be what you're looking for. I wrote it to scratch an itch, it's the 
program I wanted to keep track of my glazes and create new ones. 
Maybe it will be your program too.
