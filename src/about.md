title: About Mixup

*Mixup* was created by Ken Chin-Purcell. 
I'm a potter and I also like writing apps.

I lived in St. Paul, Minnesota for decades and had a production studio 
called Bungalow Pottery in Minneapolis. 
We returned to our native California several years ago, 
settling in North County San Diego.
My Carlsbad studio is now smaller
but my interest in ceramics is still strong.

*Mixup* is the glaze program I've always wanted, a place to keep my
current glazes and a way to discover new ones.
I hope you like *Mixup* too.

There a many programs for managing glazes, and I encourage you to check them out and pick 
the best one for your needs. They include:
- [Glaze Forge](https://glazeforge.com)
- [Insight](https://www.digitalfire.com)
- [Glazy](https://glazy.org)
- [Matrix](http://www.matrix2000.co.nz)
- [HyperGlaze](http://hyperglaze.com)

I point these out because *Mixup* takes a simplified and fairly opinionated approach, 
so it may not be what you're looking for. The above programs are more 
comprehensive and have more flexibility.
There are lots of options when it comes to glaze chemistry,
different strategies,
different ways of presenting things, 
and I didn't want to clutter Mixup with lots of bells and whistles. 
Mixup embodies the way I think of glazes.
Maybe it will be your program too.
