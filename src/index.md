## Glaze Chemistry Made Easier

**Mixup** is an app for macOS that keeps track of your glazes and materials. 
It also helps you understand your glazes better by breaking them down into
the oxides that make up all of the materials potters use. 

By looking at glazes in terms of oxides you can:
- Understand why a glaze might be crazing
- Reformulate a glaze with new materials
- Create new glazes from scratch
