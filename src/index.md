## Glaze Chemistry Made Easier

**Mixup** is an app for macOS that keeps track of your glazes and materials. 
It also helps you understand your glazes better by breaking them down into
the oxides that make up the materials potters use. 

For example, by looking at glazes in terms of oxides you can:
- Understand why a glaze might be crazing
- Reformulate a glaze with new materials
- Create a new glaze from scratch that might work

**Mixup** is distributed as a free app on the Mac App Store. It requires  
macOS Monterey (macOS 12.0 or above).

Features:
- A unified list of glazes, materials and oxides - everything is a "Mix"
- The Oxide Badge graphically shows at a glance glaze chemistry
- Analysis as percentage or UMF
- Adjust ingredients to change the analysis, or...
- Adjust the analysis to change ingredients
- Match the chemistry of another glaze, or a previous version, with one click
- Undo / redo
- Fast text search
- Tag labels organize your glazes and materials
- Keep notes on a glaze
- Batch mix calculation
- View a glaze's previous version or derived versions
