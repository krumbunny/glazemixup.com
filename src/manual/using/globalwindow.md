## The Mix List


Mixup views both materials and glazes as just collections of oxides. Materials tend to be specified in terms of oxides, 
and glazes are collections of materials. 
But you can have materials that are composed of other materials, and you can have glazes that are composed of other glazes 
or are defined in terms of oxides. In the world of Mixup everything is just a mix.

Mixup's job is to distill any mix into its oxides.

Here are a bunch of oxides:
- K2O
- N2O
- SiO2
