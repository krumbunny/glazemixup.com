## The Oxide Badge

The *oxide badge* is an original feature of Mixup. 
It was developed to give a quick impression of the oxides that make up a glaze.

The oxide badge shows a mix's oxides in graphical form. 
Consider the following analysis and oxide badge:

The badge shows in graphical form the same numbers as are in the analysis. The badge has two parts:
- The *Flux Circle*
- The *Oxide Field*

The **Flux Circle** contains all of the fluxes in the glaze, with the addition of boron oxide in the center. 
The fluxes are grouped as:

- Alkali Fluxes: Li2O, Na2O, K2O
- Alkaline Earth Fluxes: MgO, CaO, SrO, BaO
- Metallic Fluxes: ZnO, PbO

In a unity analysis the fluxes total to one, so the flux circle shows the flux oxides in a pie chart, 
adding up to one complete circle. 
You can see in the example above that the similarly colored alkali fluxes are about a quarter of the total fluxes.

**The Flux Circle should be viewed as being in front of the Oxide Field**. 
Aside from boron oxide the Flux Circle is proportionally one in size. 
In the above case the unity value of silica is 3.25, and the 
silica block behind the flux circle is 3.25 times the size of the flux circle.
