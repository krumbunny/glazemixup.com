## Tagging a Mix

You tag a Mix to describe and keep track of it. 

![Mix Tags](/images/MixTags.png)


Some Mixes are tagged as glazes, other Mixes are materials. You can also tag
your mixes with things like "studio" to keep track of what you have on hand,
"production" to show which glazes are in production, "matte", "cone6" and so on. 
By tagging your Mixes you can view  
which ones you are testing and which ones are just exploring new ideas.

 
everything is just a mix of oxides. 
In Mixup everything is a *mix*. A glaze is a mix of materials. 
Materials are a mix of oxides. 
Oxides are the root of the tree - they are just themselves, a "mix" of one oxide.

What is a glaze and what is a material in Mixup is arbitrary. A material is usually a mix of oxides, but it could be a mix of other materials. A glaze could be a mix of materials or a mix of other glazes (think line blends).
