## Tagging a Mix

You tag a Mix to describe and keep track of it. 

![Mix Tags](/images/MixTags.png)

Some Mixes are tagged as glazes, other Mixes are materials. You can also tag
your mixes with terms like "studio" to keep track of what you have on hand,
"production" to show which glazes are in production, "matte", "cone6" and so on.
By tagging your Mixes you can view which ones you are testing and
which ones are just exploring new ideas.

The only difference between a material and glaze in Mixup is that materials
are tagged with "material".  

Some tags change how Mixup treats a mix:
- "clay" and "kaolin" cause a mix's oxides to be normalized to alumina, as opposed to the sum of fluxes.
- "silica" causes a mix's oxides to be normalized to silica, as opposed to the sum of fluxes.
- "additive" causes a mix to be listed last in an ingredient list.
- "material" shows the mix with a different icon in the list.

Otherwise tags are only there to help you organize your mixes. 
Here are some suggestions:
- "cone6", "cone04" or whatever cones are appropriate for the glaze
- "oxidation" or "reduction" to indicate atmosphere
- "tested", "studio" and "production" to show how a glaze is being used
- "clear", "matte" and so forth to show glaze qualities
- "red", "blue" and other colors
