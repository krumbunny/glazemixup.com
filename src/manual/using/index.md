## Using Mixup

Mixup is an app for macOS that keeps track of your glazes and materials. 
It also helps you understand your glazes better by breaking 
them down into the oxides that make up the materials potters use.

There a many programs for managing glazes, and I encourage you to check them out and pick 
the best one for your needs. They include:
- [Insight](https://www.digitalfire.com)
- [Glazy](https://glazy.org)
- [Matrix](http://www.matrix2000.co.nz)
- [HyperGlaze](http://hyperglaze.com)

I point these out because *Mixup* takes a simplified and fairly opinionated approach, 
so it may not be what you're looking for. The above programs are more 
comprehensive and have more flexibility.
There are lots of options when it comes to glaze chemistry, different ways of presenting
things, and I didn't want to clutter Mixup with lots of bells and whistles. 
Mixup embodies the way I think of glazes.
Maybe it will be your program too.
