## Viewing a Mix

When a mix is selected from the list *Mixup* shows a summary of the mix.
Here you can see what the mix's ingredients are, what its analysis is
(in table and graphical format), and any notes you've made. 
You can add to the notes, for example with information on how it looks
when fired, but you 
can't change the makeup of the glaze in this view. To change the mix you
need to tap *Edit*.

Here are the parts of the mix view:

![Viewing a Mix](/images/ViewLabeled.png)

1. The ingredients are listed in the approximate order of how you would 
probably want mix the glaze in your studio, with clays first and additives
last. Ingredient amounts are always by weight.

2. Tags are used to keep track of mixes. Feel free to liberally use tags
to mark whether the mix is a glaze, if it is tested, it is in your studio,
what cone it fires to, atmosphere and so forth.

3. The analysis shows the relative amounts of oxide molecules by *molecule 
count* (mols), not weight. 
The first column of numbers is *Unity Molecular Formula*, or UMF.
The second column is by percentage. The only difference between the
columns is that UMF scales the numbers so that the flux oxides 
total to one, or unity.

4. The Oxide Badge shows the analysis in graphical form. The fluxes are
displayed in front as a circle, with boron oxide added in the center of
the flux circle. In back of the flux circle is a rectangle of the remaining oxides,
with alumina first, then silica, then the rest of the oxides. If the silica to alumina
ratio is 9:1 then the rectangle will be perfectly square. The dashed 45 deg 
line lets you see if the rectangle is out of square. A taller rectangle indicates 
lower silica (high alumina), and wider rectangle indicates higher silica (low alumina).

5. The icon buttons in the upper left:
- Create a new version based on this mix
- Copy a text version of the mix to the clipboard
- Print

6. Use notes to keep track of how this glaze performs in use. Record your batches 
here as you mix them and take notes on how the glaze looks 
when fired.

7. *Mix Batch* brings up a simple dialog to create a batch of this mix as a 
multiple of the ingredient weights. You can either print the batch or save it to notes.
