# Organize and Understand Your Glazes

Mixup keeps track of your glazes and helps you understand them. 
You can use Mixup to catalog the glazes you use and develop new glazes. 
All of your glazes and materials are kept in one list:

Mixup takes a simplified view of glazes and materials:
everything in Mixup is a *mix*. A mix is a mixture of other mixes or oxides. 
Every mix has a list of ingredient mixes by weight.
So glazes are a mix, materials are a mix and glaze blends are a mix. 
Oxides are just themselves, a molecule with a weight,
are they are the building blocks of Mixup. It's mixes all the way down to oxides. 

Materials are usually specified in terms of oxides, like this analysis of Custer Feldspar:

Glazes are usually collections of materials, like this [cone 6 glaze](https://digitalfire.com/recipe/g1214w) from Digital Fire:

But you can have materials that are composed of other materials, 
and you can have glazes that are line blends composed of other glazes 
or are defined in terms of oxides. In the world of Mixup everything is a mix.

Mixup's job is to distill any mix into an analysis of its constituent oxides.
