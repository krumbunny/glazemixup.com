# Organize and Understand Your Glazes

Mixup keeps track of your glazes and helps you understand them. 
You can use Mixup to catalog the glazes you use and develop new glazes. 
Mixup takes a simplified approach to the world of glaze chemistry.

Glaze chemistry is a well developed field.
There a many programs for managing and analyzing glazes, 
and I encourage you to check them out and pick 
the best one for your needs. They include:
- [Glaze Forge](https://glazeforge.com)
- [Insight](https://www.digitalfire.com)
- [Glazy](https://glazy.org)
- [Matrix](http://www.matrix2000.co.nz)
- [HyperGlaze](http://hyperglaze.com)

I point these out because *Mixup* takes a simplified and fairly opinionated approach, 
so it may not be what you're looking for. The above programs are more 
comprehensive and have more flexibility.
There are lots of options when it comes to glaze chemistry, 
different approaches and
different ways of presenting
things, and I didn't want to clutter Mixup with lots of bells and whistles. 
Mixup embodies the way I think of glazes.
Maybe it will be your program too.
