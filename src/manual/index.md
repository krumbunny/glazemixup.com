# Organize and Understand Your Glazes

*Mixup* keeps track of your glazes and helps you understand them. 
You can use *Mixup* to catalog the glazes you use, fix problems and develop new glazes.

*Mixup* takes a simplified approach to the world of glaze chemistry, showing your
glazes and materials in a single list. Tables of numbers are unavoidable when it
comes to glaze chemistry, but *Mixup* tries to minimize clutter where it can and
portray some values graphically instead of just numerically.

Glaze chemistry is a well developed field.
There a many programs for managing and analyzing glazes, 
and I encourage you to check them out and pick 
the best one for your needs. They include:
- [Glaze Forge](https://glazeforge.com)
- [Insight](https://www.digitalfire.com)
- [Glazy](https://glazy.org)
- [Matrix](http://www.matrix2000.co.nz)
- [HyperGlaze](http://hyperglaze.com)

I point these out because *Mixup* takes a simplified and fairly opinionated approach, 
so it may not be what you're looking for. The above programs are more 
comprehensive and have more flexibility.
There are lots of options when it comes to glaze chemistry, 
different approaches and
different ways of presenting
things, and I didn't want to clutter *Mixup* with lots of bells and whistles. 
*Mixup* embodies the way I think of glazes.
Maybe it will be your program too.
