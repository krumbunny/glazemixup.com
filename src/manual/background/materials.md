## The different kinds of materials

An simplified way of looking at materials is that they are all just baskets of oxides,
with each material bringing more or less of various oxides to the mix. 
This is what Mixup's oxide analysis shows. 
But keep in mind that it is a simplification.

In the real world materials are of course more complex. 
They have different melting properties 
depending on their molecular structure and how they are ground and processed. 
Many materials have trace amounts of oxides that don't show up in the official analysis.
Most materials that are directly mined from the ground vary a bit.
Manufacturers have various strategies to try and keep a material consistent, 
but many materials drift in analysis over time.

For this reason glaze analysis often works best as a comparison tool. 
If you know how an existing glaze fires in your kiln then analysis is often 
a great way of creating a similar glaze or changing the glaze you have.

Broadly speaking pottery materials break down into these kinds:
- clays
- feldspars
- silica
- frits
- fluxes
- additives
 
*Clays* and *feldspars* are mined and over the years come a go depending
on the size of the deposit. 
Both clay and feldspar are composed mostly of silica and alumina.
Feldspars are often characterized by a alkaline flux component, 
so you see soda feldspars, potash feldspars and lithia feldspars,
indicating the primary flux in the mineral.

*Silica* used to be provided by mined flint, which contained some other trace
oxides, but now is a fairly pure material.

Most of the time potters prefer a non-soluble mineral. 
Having a material dissolve in water leads to uneven application. 
Some oxides, like boron, are difficult to find in a non-soluble form.

A *frit* is a man made material that is previously molten glass that is cooled and powdered.
Frits have good melting properties and are a great source of 
oxides like boron that are difficult to find otherwise in non-soluble form.

*Fluxes* can be provided in many mineral forms. 
Dolomite for example provides calcia and magnesia together. 
Wollastonite provides calcia and silica.

*Additives* are many and varied, ranging from metallic oxides like 
copper oxide used for coloring to CMC gum, an additive that improves how
a glaze goes on the pot but completely burns off in the kiln.
