## The different kinds of materials

An aloof way of looking at materials is that they are all just baskets of oxides,
with each material bringing more or less of various oxides to the mix.

But in the real world materials are of course more complex. They have different melting properties 
depending on how they are ground and processed. 
Many materials have trace amounts of oxides that don't show up in the official analysis.
Most materials that are directly mined from the ground also vary a bit.
The manufacturers try their best to be consistent, but materials do drift over time.

But it is often these imperfections that make pottery glazes interesting. 
We potters celebrate the oddities of various materials, even though they sometimes make
understanding how a glaze is succeeding or failing difficult. 

Broadly speaking pottery materials break down into these kinds:
- clays
- feldspars
- silica
- frits
- fluxes
- additives
