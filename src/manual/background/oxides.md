## Oxides: The Building Blocks of Glazes

Atoms may be the building blocks of the universe,
but for pottery purposes the basic unit is an oxide, a molecule consisting 
of an element plus oxygen. Oxygen is so pervasive and reactive that
it's easiest to think of elements in terms of its oxygenated molecule.

So in glaze parlance you would talk about Sodium (Na) as Soda (Na2O). 
Silicon (Si) as Silica (SiO2), Potassium (K) as Potash (K2O), 
Aluminum (Al) as Alumina (Al2O3), Magnesium (Mg) as Magnesia (MgO) and so on. 
Except for outliers like Flourine an element in pottery is usually attached to oxygen, 
and together they are an oxide.
These oxides are the main characters in glaze chemistry. 
They are the building blocks of glazes.

Elements like to pair up with oxygen in different ratios. 
Some prefer two atoms to one oxygen, like Soda (Na2O) and Potash (K2O).
Others pair one to one, like Calcia (CaO) and Magnesia (MgO). 
A ratio of two to three is how Alumina (Al2O3), Boron (B2O3) 
and Iron (Fe2O3) like to pair. 
Silica and Titania pair up at one to two (SiO2 and TiO2).

Broadly speaking oxides can be grouped according to how they pair with oxygen. 

Glazes are mostly composed of silica and alumina, 
but silica and alumina by themselves are pretty inert.
To get those oxides to melt at kiln temperatures we introduce fluxes, 
like soda, potash and calcia. 
These fluxes cause the alumina and silica to melt at lower temperatures.
There is also a whole herd of additive oxides, 
like iron oxide (*aka* rust), boron oxide, and titania,
that add color and texture. 

The common oxides we see in glazes are also incidentally what the 
[world is made out of](https://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/0127/report.pdf). 
Your average mountain is mostly silica and alumina, 
usually bound up with some other oxides in various rocky minerals. 
A very common type of mineral is *feldspar*, 
where one of those flux oxides is bound up with alumina and silica.
Your clay supplier probably carries soda and potash feldspars, 
along with more exotic feldspars like spodumene, a lithium feldspar.

A feldspar over eons of weathering might decompose, with the fluxes 
being washed away. You might wind up with just some alumina, 
silica and chemical water bound together in tiny platelets.
That's *clay*.

You can see why a feldspar is a good starting point for getting the 
basic oxide ingredients you need for a glaze. 
Add some more silica and clay (for alumina) as needed,
some flux material to get it all to melt, 
maybe an additive for color, and voila, you have a glaze!

### Oxide Roles

Most of glaze, as in 50%-80%, is silica. 

Alumina stiffens up a glaze. Transparent glazes often have a silica to 
alumina ratio of about 9:1.

Soda and Potash act very similarly and are strong fluxes. 
They also expand a lot when heated, causing crazing when the glaze cools.
Lithia is also in this group of Alkaline Fluxes.

Calcia, Magnesia, Baria and Strontia are all Alkaline Earth Fluxes. 
They may not be quite as strong as the Alkaline Fluxes but they also expand
less.

Lead and Zinc oxides are Metallic Fluxes.

Boric Oxide (B2O3) is unique and very useful. It may not formally be a flux but
it acts in concert with other oxides to lower the melting temperature and also lower 
expansion. 

Other oxides like Titania, Iron Oxide, and various metals (Copper, Cobalt) are used 
to change the color and surface of a glaze.

There is a special oxide in Mixup that isn't an oxide at all: LOI. 
LOI stands for Lost On Ignition, and it's a stand in for
the stuff in a material that burns up in the kiln. It has an oxide weight of zero. 
You can add LOI to a material analysis to make it tally to 100% but it 
won't show up in the oxide analysis.
