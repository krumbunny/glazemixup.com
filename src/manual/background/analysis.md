## Oxide Analysis

Suppose you see a faded glaze recipe scrawled on an old studio wall, "Leach 1234"

- Kaolin 1
- Whiting 2
- Silica 3
- Feldspar 4

And you think "Hmmmm, what might this ancient glaze recipe be good for?"

After entering it into Mixup you get:

The analysis tallies up the oxides and tells you the inside story. 
The first thing to note is the "(mol)", which indicates that this
analysis is in terms of molecules, or moles, and not by weight. 
Some molecules are heavier than others, but a heavy molecule isn't
necessarily more active or important than a light one. It makes more sense to
look at the glaze in terms of molecule count.

There are two ways to present the molecule tally: Percent and Unity.
The second column is percent and is easy enough to understand. 
In this glaze for example 23% of the molecules are calcia. 
All the molecules total up to 100%.

Another way to scale the numbers is to make the flux molecules 
to sum to one. It's known as a Unity formulation and is 
the first column of numbers in the analysis. For a Unity formula 
the oxide amount is in proportion to all the fluxes. In this case the calcia is
0.85, or 85% of the fluxes. The silica is 2.45, so
there are 2.45 silica molecules for every flux molecule.

Unity Molecular Formula (aka UMF) is also known as Seger Formula. 
In UMF the fluxes will add to one but the other oxides can range. 
Unity formula is a great way to see what the ratio of flux to 
silica and other oxides is. In this case we see 0.25 mols of alumina
(adequate) and 2.45 mols of silica, which isn't much compared to other glazes.
Without boron to help things melt though this is probably a high temperature glaze. 

Both columns show the same ratios, so in that sense they are the same. 
The first column scales everything so that the fluxes sum to 1.
The second column scales everything so the grand total is 100%. 
Same counts of molecules, but different scales.
