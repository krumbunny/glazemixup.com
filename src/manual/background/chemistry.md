## A Quick Potter's Tour of Glaze Chemistry

Pottery involves a lot of process and transformation, 
with lots of opportunity for things to go wrong.
When it comes to glazes a basic chemical understanding of what's going on can 
help a potter a long ways towards fixing common problems like substituting a material or fixing 
a glaze fit. 

But I get it, we're potters, not chemists. I'm sure there are some chemist potters out there, 
but by and large potters are mainly interested in making fine craft and beautiful objects.
If chemistry needs to make an appearance let's make it as friendly and brief as possible.

So here goes:

Most glazes are slurries of crushed rocks and water. You dip your pots in, it soaks up some
slurry, the water dries and you are left with powder on the outside of the clay.

When you fire your pot and the kiln is at temperature the powdered glaze on the outside melts and becomes a thick liquid. 
In that hot liquid the atoms that were bound up in various rocky crystals and other materials are 
freed to roam around and interact with other atoms. It's a molecule soup. 

When the kiln is turned off and the pot cools the soup freezes - that's the glaze. 
Sometimes the soup freezes relatively quickly and the molecules are caught off guard, 
as if they were still in that sticky liquid, creating a clear glaze. 
Other times the molecules have time to 
find a friend and create a small crystal or an optical blip, leading to matte glazes
and other effects.

### Oxides

You *could* think about the molecules in that glaze soup in terms of elements, 
like silicon or iron or aluminum, but there's one element
that is pesky - oxygen. We live in a world bathed in oxygen and it's very reactive.
Oxygen glues itself to other elements and does't let go, even at kiln temperatures.
So when it comes to glazes it's best to think not about elements but oxides - the element plus it's tag along oxygen. 

So in glaze parlance you would talk about Sodium as Soda. 
Silicon as Silica, Calcium as Calcia, Aluminum as Alumina, Magnesium as Magnesia and so on.
These oxides are the main characters in glaze chemistry. They are the building blocks of glazes.

Elements like to pair up with oxygen in different ratios. 
Some prefer two atoms to one oxygen, like Soda (Na2O) and Potash (K2O).
Others pair one to one, like Calcia (CaO) and Magnesia (MgO). 
A ratio of two to three is how Alumina (Al2O3), Boron (B2O3) and Iron (Fe2O3) like to pair. 
Silica and Titanium pair up at one to two (SiO2 and TiO2).

The most abundant oxide in glazes is silica, and the next most is alumina. 
On their own alumina and silica are pretty inert.
To get those oxides to melt at kiln temperatures we introduce flux oxides, like soda, potash and calcia. 
And then there are a whole herd of additive oxides, like iron oxide (*aka* rust), boron oxide, and titania,
that add color and texture. 

The common oxides we see in glazes are also what the world is made out of. 
Your average mountain is mostly silica and alumina, 
usually bound up with some other oxides in various rocky minerals. 
A very common type of mineral is *feldspar*, where one of those flux oxides is bound up in a package with a alumina and silica.
If you wash away that flux over the eons you might wind up with just some alumina, 
silica and chemical water bound together in tiny platelets.
That's *clay*.
