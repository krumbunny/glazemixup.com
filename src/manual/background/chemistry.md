## A Potter's Tour of Glaze Chemistry

Pottery involves process and transformation, 
with lots of opportunity for magic to happen or things to go wrong.
The biggest changes to a pot happen in the kiln, where high heat changes
dry clay covered with powdered rock to ceramic encased in a thin layer of glass. 
The change from unfired to fired is dramatic and often unpredictable.

A lot of the changes to a pot while it's in the kiln are chemical.
In particular what happens when the raw glaze melts is largely driven by 
what kinds of atoms are part of the glaze. 
For example if there's too much silica the glaze might not melt, or
if there's too much soda the glaze might craze.
A basic chemical understanding goes
a long ways towards fixing common glaze problems like under firing, crazing, 
substituting a material or fixing the glaze fit. 

Fortunately complicated chemistry isn't needed; there aren't any chemical reactions to worry about.
The kind of chemistry analysis that Mixup provides is fairly simple but is 
nevertheless useful for getting a basic handle on what's going on. 
In a nutshell, for a given glaze, Mixup goes through the ingredients, tallies up 
what kind oxides are present, and gives you the summary analysis.

The main thing is to learn what [role each oxide plays](/manual/background/oxides). 
Some oxides like silica and alumina are always present, familiar parts of any glaze.
There's always some flux oxides, but which ones and how much vary between glazes.
Other oxides are optional and give a glaze its color and character.

Glaze chemistry is an established field, 
with many books written and college courses developed.

### Glaze Chemistry: The Really Brief Version 

Most glazes are slurries of crushed rocks and water. You dip your pot in, 
it soaks up some slurry, the water dries and 
you are left with powder on the outside of the pot.

When you fire your pot and the kiln is at temperature the powdered glaze 
on the outside melts and becomes a thick liquid. 
In that hot liquid the molecules that were bound up in various rocky crystals 
and other materials are 
freed to roam around and interact with other molecules. It's molecule soup. 

When the kiln is turned off and the pot cools the soup freezes - that's the glaze. 
Sometimes the soup freezes relatively quickly and the molecules are caught off guard, 
as if they were still in that liquid melt, creating a clear glaze. 
Other times the molecules have time to 
find a friend and create a small crystal or an optical blip, leading to matte glazes
and other effects.

You *could* think about the molecules in that glaze soup in terms of elements, 
like silicon or iron or aluminum, but there's one element
that is almost always attached - oxygen. 
We live in a world bathed in oxygen and it's very reactive.
Oxygen glues itself to other elements and doesn't let go, even at kiln temperatures.
So when it comes to glazes it's best to think not about elements but oxides - 
the element plus it's tag along oxygen.
